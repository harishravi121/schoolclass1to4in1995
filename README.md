Learnt fantastic codes happily in turtle and in vijayawada played a bit in cousins place in chennai during 1995s summers.

I used a floppy at age 6 in 1995. To use wordstar digger etc.

Made traffic signal turtle and painted in many competitions and won.

Regret not requesting for turtle from school to home. also repaired a speedometer partially at age 8..

Speedo meter testers looked as precursors to first electro mechanical computers.

A note to add is the mechanical calculator in museum and vacuum tube computer which are amazing to use someday on a sponsored trip. of  1600-1800s
